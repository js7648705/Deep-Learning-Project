# Deep-Learning-Project
* Developed a Keras model to predict a whether or not the borrow pay back the loan in full to the lending club. th
  -	Performed exploratory data analysis
  -	Cleaned the data by removing or filling the missing value with the mean of other features
  -	Converted the categorical features into dummy variables
  -	Applied feature engineering to create new features
  -	Evaluated the model by creating classification report and confusion matrix

**Python's libraries used for this project** \
